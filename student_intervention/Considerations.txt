Decision tree:
+ Deals with non linear separable data, specially with a lot of parameters
+ Easy to understand
- Overfit
+ Can be used in an emsemble

SVM
+ Nice separation even with non linear spaces
- Very sensitive to noise (School system, however, not so much noise)
- Probel with large data base (school not large)

KNN
+ Similar points, similar properties
+ Can easily adapt to new data
+ Easy to explain
- Dimensonality problem (not so much features)
